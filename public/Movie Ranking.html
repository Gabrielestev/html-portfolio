 <h1>The Best Top Movies ALL Time According to Gabriel</h1>
 <h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
 <hr />

 <h3>Samurai X</h3>
 <p>This is one of my favorite movies because it shows a lot about japanese<br/> history and the movie was based on the anime.</p>
 
 <h3>Matrix</h3>
 <p>For me Matrix is a documentary Movie. It shows how the mind works<br />
and how we can change our reality. Like Neo did. We can use our Neocortex and thing out of the box!
Believe in yourself!</p>
 
 <h3>Inception</h3>
 <p>This movie is like Matrix. It is a psychological movie.<br />
Really you need to pay atention about every second of the movie.<br/>
It shows how lucid dreams work and how we are in a dream<br />
That what we are experiancing now it is just not more than a dream. </p>
